__Wizard Fuel__

This app is a demo of a JavaScript / Coffeescript based wizard as an alternative to more complex controller / partial based wizards like Wicked https://github.com/schneems/wicked

Plan is to continue refactoring the code and create a gem for the Rails asset pipeline.

__TODO__

* Re-right javascript so that data steps donâ€™t have to be hidden/unhidden manually
* Add clientside validations - possible solution: https://github.com/bcardarella/client_side_validations
